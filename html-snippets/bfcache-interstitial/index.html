<div>
  <p>Trying to make BFCache and interstitials work.
    Currently (131.0.6778.139),
    this seems to demonstrate a bug in navigation.</p>

  <p>What's supposed to happen is
  <ol>
    <li>Click button to "show" interstitial
      (under the hood, push a new URL with a fragment).</li>
    <li>Click button again to "dismiss" interstitial
      and navigate to the destination
      (under the hood, go back and then navigate to the destination).</li>
    <li>Click back to get back to the original page from BFCache
      with no interstitial visible</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>What's actually happening is that most times,
    going back goes back twice
    (to the NTP or whatever page you were on before you came to this demo).
    This looks like a bug
    because long-press on the back button shows the original page
    as the previous history entry.
  </p>

<button id="goButton">show interstitial</button>
<pre id="logPre"></pre>
