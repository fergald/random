<div>
  <p>Trying to make BFCache and interstitials work.</p>

  <p>What's supposed to happen is
  <ol>
    <li>Click button to "show" interstitial
      (under the hood, push a new URL with a fragment).</li>
    <li>Click button again to "dismiss" interstitial
      and navigate to the destination
      (under the hood, `history.back` and then navigate to the destination).</li>
    <li>Click back to get back to the original page from BFCache
      with no interstitial visible</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<button id="goButton">show interstitial</button>
<pre id="logPre"></pre>
<script src=index.js>

</script>
