This page lets you play around with various attempts at causing a file-chooser
to race with navigating or opening a new tab.

With Chrome, most of these are blocked. The only one that does something odd
is if you cause navigation in the same tab to happen after the dialog is opened.
The dialog stays open.
It's not a security bug since the page is not BFCache,
so the result of picking a file cannot be seen by the JS.
