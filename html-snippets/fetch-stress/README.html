Simple stress test of keep-alive fetches.
<p>Run a simple webserver, e.g
  <pre>python3 -m http.server |& tee /tmp/log</pre>
<p>Then go to <a href="1.html#0">1.html#0</a> to start it.
  You probably need to paste that URL and hit enter.
<p>After running, check the logs to see if you received all of the fetches.
<p>This will refuse to run on github because you don't have access to the logs
  and you'll just be pointlessly slamming their servers.
