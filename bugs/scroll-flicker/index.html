The only difference between these 2 pages is that one starts with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt</code>
<p>
  <a href="page.html">without doctype we get a scrollbar</a>
<p>
  <a href="page.doctype.html">with doctype we get no scrollbar</a>

<p>
  With the scrolling version there is noticeable flicker in the sticky
  headers on Android
